#SINS is an os kernel.Simplicity is not simple.


INTRODUCTION
    Hello, every body.I have made a multi-task, kernel-preemption kernel. It can run in i386-pc but just support old MINIX filesystem(read-only mode) now (like old linux 0.11).
    I have written 12000 lines to create this kernel, including bootsect, scheduler, memory-mangement, a toy vfs, irq management, a toy singal model and so on. It cost me half a year to do research, think and code. Now, get down to business.
    
    
INSTALL
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1.1) pull this project to you computer(Need a unix-like environment, such as LINUX).
    1.2) search BACKUP_DIR and MOUNT_DIR in Makefile.You need create two directory for them.
       I create /var/sins.backup for BACKUP_DIR and /var/sins.disk for MOUNT_DIR.
    1.3) install BOCHS or QEMU for emulation.
    
    2.1) run `make help` to get some useful commands.
    2.2) run `make bochs` or `make qemu`.
    
    3.1) If you have got a shell. CONGRATULATIONS! You have run it succesfully!
    3.2) I have write some user-mode programs such as wc, ls, cat, echo, date, ps and built in cd, exit, kill
         If you have no idea, type `cd bin` and `ls`.
    -------------------------------over----------------------------------------
    IF you failed in mount. confirm your /dev/loop0 is not used and retry. Sometimes I need try three times.
    
    Don't expect too much of it. It's just a toy os NOW.
    This project is the practice of a meaningful to me. I can grasp the general framework of the kernel, but also get a lot of experience and lessons. I hope to be able to reconstruct all of the code, change a kind of design thinking, perhaps the kernel design can become more simple, faster and more scalable.

    You will give me a lot of power for its support. Now I am a graduating college students. I also want to have plenty of time to let me have the freedom of study and faster update my kernel. I hope this kernel can have practical value. Obviously it is not, he is just a child. But it is precisely because of this, he has a lot of potential. I hope he can have a POSIX programming interface, because WINDOWS really do too bad.
    If you read Linux source code, reading the kernel should be a simple thing. But you shouldn't forget that it's not LINUX. If not, what I have done means nothing. You should pay more attention to the interface provided by the kernel rather than the interface implementation.
    I did not choose the optimized algorithm. Some obscure part I may be used directly in the early version of the project, or perhaps I didn't get the correct understanding of this part before.

    If you have any thoughts on this project, CONTACT ME.
